This paper examines the monitoring practices of nonbank direct lenders by analyzing the
use of information covenants in loan contracts. Analyzing 688 hand-collected nonbank direct
loans, I find that nonbank lenders request firmsâ€™ accounting information more often than banks
in the syndicated loan market. Significant heterogeneity exists among nonbank lenders: private
credit lenders employ information covenants more frequently than other nonbanks such as finance
companies, while larger nonbank lenders and those with specialized industry expertise are more
likely to incorporate lender meetings into their monitoring practices. These results suggest that
nonbank direct lenders actively monitor borrowers through frequent information requests. This
study highlights the critical role of accounting information in nonbank lending and sheds light on
how nonbanks use information covenants to monitor their borrowers.
