This paper examines how tax policy affects borrower-lender negotiations in syndicated
loan markets. Using the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 as a natural experiment,
we analyze changes in loan terms for firms facing higher after-tax borrowing costs due to
limits on interest deductibility. We find that borrowers most likely to face limited interest
deductibility negotiate lower interest rates post-TCJA. Importantly, we observe no changes
in non-price terms such as covenants, maturities, or collateral requirements, suggesting that
lenders share the incidence of tax policy burdens with borrowers rather than offsetting
reduced rates through stricter loan terms. The results are concentrated in borrowers that
operate in industries that saw increased lender competition after the TCJA. We also find
no evidence of changes in the creditworthiness of firms with limited interested deductibility
post-TCJA, suggesting that the change in loan spreads is not attributable to changes in
borrower fundamentals. Our findings highlight borrower tax burden sharing with lenders
as a novel channel through which tax policy influences corporate financing dynamics and
credit markets.
